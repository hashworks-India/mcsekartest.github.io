Whether it's landing your dream job or getting the girl, a basic mathematical principle can help you in almost any situation.
That's according to Hannah Fry, a mathematician at the UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis in London and author of new book, "The Mathematics of Love."

She describes the "stable marriage problem," or the challenge of matching two entities so that neither would be better off in another match, and explains the Gale-Shapley matching algorithm often used to solve it. Exploiting this algorithm can be a great strategy for getting what you want.
